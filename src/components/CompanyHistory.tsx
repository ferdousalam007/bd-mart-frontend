          <span className="text-primary-text font-medium">Drive</span>{" "}
          <span className="text-primary-brand font-medium">Now</span> was
          founded in 2010 with a simple yet powerful vision: to redefine the way
          people experience mobility. Recognizing a growing need for accessible
          and flexible transportation options, our founders set out to create a
          car rental service that prioritized customer satisfaction,
          convenience, and affordability. In the early years,{" "}
          <span className="text-primary-text font-medium">Drive</span>{" "}
          <span className="text-primary-brand font-medium">Now</span> started as
          a small operation with just a handful of vehicles, catering to a local
          community that quickly embraced the idea of renting cars on an
          as-needed basis. Word of our reliable service and competitive pricing
          spread rapidly, and within a few years,{" "}
          <span className="text-primary-text font-medium">Drive</span>{" "}
          <span className="text-primary-brand font-medium">Now</span> expanded
          its fleet and service areas, becoming a trusted name in car rentals
          across multiple cities. Throughout the 2010s, as the demand for car
          rentals grew,{" "}
          <span className="text-primary-text font-medium">Drive</span>{" "}
          <span className="text-primary-brand font-medium">Now</span> invested
          heavily in technology to streamline the rental process. We introduced
          an online booking system, mobile apps, and a customer support
          platform, making it easier than ever for customers to rent a vehicle
          whenever they needed one. These innovations, coupled with our
          commitment to maintaining a diverse and well-maintained fleet, allowed
          us to continue expanding while maintaining our core values. By 2020,{" "}
          <span className="text-primary-text font-medium">Drive</span>{" "}
          <span className="text-primary-brand font-medium">Now</span> had
          established itself as a leader in the car rental industry, known for
          our exceptional customer service, diverse vehicle selection, and a
          wide range of rental plans tailored to meet the needs of different
          types of travelers. We also introduced eco-friendly vehicles to our
          fleet, reflecting our commitment to sustainability and our customers'
          growing preference for greener options. Today,{" "}
          <span className="text-primary-text font-medium ">Drive</span>{" "}
          <span className="text-primary-brand font-medium">Now</span> operates
          in numerous locations nationwide, with a fleet that includes
          everything from compact cars to luxury SUVs, catering to a wide range
          of customer needs. Our mission remains the same: to provide
          convenient, reliable, and affordable transportation solutions that
          empower our customers to enjoy the freedom of mobility without the
          burden of car ownership. As we look to the future, we are excited to
          continue innovating and expanding our services to meet the evolving
          needs of our customers.
